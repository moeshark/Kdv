# Kdv

This repository contains all files for the project: Data-driven Predictions of Rogue Waves Using Reservoir Computing. 

Guidelines for running the code:

You only need to run: kdv.m , kdv_fft_plots.m, rmse_plots.m, rmse_plots_2.m. All other files are functions. Please ensure all of these files are stored in the same directory.

kdv.m generates Figure 6

kdv_fft_plots.m generates Figures 2 and 3. Note: to generate either Figure, you will need to change up the parameters

rmse_plots.m generates Figure 7

rmse_plots_2.m generates Figure 8

Figure 1 was generated by a short Mathematica script kdv_rogue_plot.nb. Please try running this file, I have never tried running .nb files from Github before.
